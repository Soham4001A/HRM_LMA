Purpose : Provides the Latent Meta Attention (LMA) initial transformation
          module. This module is responsible for converting a standard
          input tensor into a lower-dimensional latent representation
          on which efficient attention can be performed.

class LMAInitialTransform(nn.Module):
    """
    Implements the LMA pre-processing pipeline to transform an input tensor
    into a latent space representation, following the PointNet example.

    The pipeline consists of these steps:
    1.  **Split & Stack**: The input tensor's embedding dimension `d0` is split
        into `H` heads. These heads are then stacked along the sequence dimension,
        creating a longer, thinner tensor of shape (B, L*H, d0/H).
    2.  **Re-chunk & Embed**: This longer tensor is then "re-chunked" (reshaped)
        to a new sequence length `L_new` and projected by a linear layer to the
        final latent dimension `d_new`.

    A linear projection of the **original** input tensor is also computed and
    added as a residual connection to the transformed tensor, ensuring that
    information from the original space is preserved.
